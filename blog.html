        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>I started this blog for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I needed to design a responsive homepage for a project in this <a href="https://theodinproject.com">web development course</a>.</li>
          <li>I miss the html and css playground that was MySpace circa 2006-2007.</li>
          <li>I wanted a place to publish my personal writings, projects, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first week or so I'll probably be linking and adding some essential content to provide context to the Cursebreakers project, supplimentary studies and surrounding dramas that are worth blogging about.</p>
        <p>Among the things I plan to post on this site:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Links to resources, tools and references that I have found helpful.</li>
          <li>Books I am currently reading and/or highly recommend reading.</li>
          <li>Updates about <a href="https://cursebreakers.net">Cursebreakers</a> and my journey as a founder.</li>
          <li>Updates  in general about my studies, research, projects, etc.</li>
          <li>Whatever else that I decide the world needs to know about my life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currently, there is no plan to use a mailing list or social media outlet to broadcast this blog. Updates will be posted to this site only.</p>
        <p>Readers are encouraged to get in touch to discuss any related (or unrelated) topics. Should you have any questions or feedback, feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@cursebreakers.net">hello@cursebreakers.net</a></p>
        <p>Until next time,</p>
        <p>-Esau</p>
